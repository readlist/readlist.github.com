Dear Customers,

In 2005, we launched a program called Amazon Prime. For just $79 a year, Prime members got unlimited Free Two-Day Shipping on a million different products. Prime was an outstanding offer and many people joined the program.

Today, seven years later, Prime is even better. You now get unlimited Free Two-Day Shipping on 15 million products. Prime also now gives you unlimited instant streaming of over 22,000 movies and TV episodes, as well as the Kindle Owners' Lending Library, an exclusive service where Kindle owners can borrow from a library of over 180,000 books for free, with no due dates. And despite all this investment, Prime remains just $79 a year.


Millions of people are already members. In fact, we now ship more items with Prime Free Two-Day Shipping than with Free Super Saver Shipping. If you haven't tried Prime yet, you can start a one-month free trial today. We think it's the best bargain in the history of shopping, and we hope you do too.

Happy shopping, happy watching, and happy reading,

Jeff Bezos
Founder & CEO
