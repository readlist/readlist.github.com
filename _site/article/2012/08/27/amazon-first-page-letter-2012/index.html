  <p>Dear Customers,</p>

<p>In 2005, we launched a program called Amazon Prime. For just $79 a year, Prime members got unlimited Free Two-Day Shipping on a million different products. Prime was an outstanding offer and many people joined the program.</p>

<p>Today, seven years later, Prime is even better. You now get unlimited Free Two-Day Shipping on 15 million products. Prime also now gives you unlimited instant streaming of over 22,000 movies and TV episodes, as well as the Kindle Owners&#8217; Lending Library, an exclusive service where Kindle owners can borrow from a library of over 180,000 books for free, with no due dates. And despite all this investment, Prime remains just $79 a year.</p>

<p>Millions of people are already members. In fact, we now ship more items with Prime Free Two-Day Shipping than with Free Super Saver Shipping. If you haven&#8217;t tried Prime yet, you can start a one-month free trial today. We think it&#8217;s the best bargain in the history of shopping, and we hope you do too.</p>

<p>Happy shopping, happy watching, and happy reading,</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos Founder &amp; CEO</p>
